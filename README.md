The Netflix Clone project is a front-end web development exercise aimed at replicating the user interface of Netflix using only HTML and CSS. This project focuses on creating a visually appealing and responsive design that mirrors the layout, styling, and features of the original Netflix homepage. It includes elements such as a header with a logo and navigation menu, a banner section, movie thumbnails, and a footer. The goal is to practice and enhance skills in HTML for structuring content and CSS for styling and layout, while ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsive design.
